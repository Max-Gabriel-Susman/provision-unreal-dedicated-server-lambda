# provision-unreal-dedicated-server-lamda

AWS Lambda That Is Invoked By Unreal Clients to Provision All the services needed for Launching an Unreal Dedicated Server

## Operations

### provision unreal-dedicated-server-vpc

### Provision unreal-dedicated-server-eks-cluster

I need to determine if the eks cluster is just going to be in the cf for the instance or if it will be it's own repo
